Sect of Eglan - This political movement seeks to overthrow the oppressive rule of the Emporer of the Sun. They are tolerated but not endorsed openly, and spoken of as an embarrassment behind closed doors.


Commerce: Entire society operates as a collective. Coinage received from foreign trade is reserved exclusively for foreign purchases, all internal commerce is strictly barter. The Gnomish stronghold of the Keep of Blackmoor buys lumber, furniture, seafood, barrels, bows, arrows, hemp, clothing and gems. In return the Clans tend to buy salt, spices, jewelry and high-quality gnomish weapons, retooled for an Elven market.
